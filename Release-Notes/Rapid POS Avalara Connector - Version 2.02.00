# Rapid POS Avalara Connector v2.02.00 Release Notes

**Release Notes Release Date:** February 18th, 2026

## Enhancement: Marketplace Location Code Support

Many online marketplaces, such as eBay and GunBroker, collect and remit sales tax on behalf of the seller. Because tax is handled directly by the marketplace, these transactions do not require real-time tax calculation through Avalara. However, the gross sales amounts from these marketplace transactions still contribute toward economic nexus thresholds. For this reason, completed marketplace sales must often be recorded in Avalara — without calculating tax — so that Avalara can include them in nexus determination and reporting.

V 2.02.00 of the Rapid POS Avalara Connector now supports this requirement through Marketplace Location Codes.
